# MetaWatch Community Edition

This is the source of the customised, community built Android manager app for MetaWatch, based off of Noah's fork of MetaWatch Community Edition (which itself is a fork of benjymous's).

It was originally based on the official MetaWatch manager (see README.orig)

The new features include:

- Support for the Android 4.3 Notification API
- More to come soon
